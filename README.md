There 3 Types Of Solutions

1.simple_solution.java Contains Simplest Solution Possible With O(n^2) Time Complexity.

2.countchars.java Contains Best Possible Solution With O(nLogn) Time Complexity.

3. hashmap_solution.java Contains Best Possible Solution With O(n) Time Complexity.but Hashmap is unordered collection so randomly shows output ina coding challenge if output doesnt match exactly then it will be inavlid.
